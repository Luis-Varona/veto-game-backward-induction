# veto-game-backwards-induction

An algorithm to construct the extensive form of a veto game and perform backward induction to find a solution. The current version can solve an 8-player game in under 0.5 seconds (and can find solutions for more complex games as well given more time).

__WORK IN PROGRESS:__ Still need to take into account equally optimal strategies for a certain player. Additionally, need to add larger test cases (e.g., 15+ players) and a function to generate a random veto game.
